# üéôÔ∏è VoiceLine - Audio Transcription & Summarization with AWS Lambda

This project provides two AWS Lambda functions for end-to-end processing of voice input. It transcribes raw audio using OpenAI‚Äôs Whisper model and summarizes the resulting text into a structured format, ideal for analyzing sales conversations.
